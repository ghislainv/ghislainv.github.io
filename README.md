## Website code

This code is used for my professional website at http://ecology.ghslnv.net. I adapted the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) template to create a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) web-site written in [Mardown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
