*** Community ecology
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: community-ecology
:END:

#+name: bioscenemada
In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of two or more
different species occupying the same geographical area. Community
ecology encompasses the study of the interactions between species in
communities on many spatial and temporal scales. This includes the
distribution, structure, abundance and demography of species
interacting in the community. Within our research group, we are mainly
focused on forest ecosystems and assemblage of tree species. While
increasing scientific knowledge on forest ecosystems, our objective is
to improve forest management and enhance forest ecosystem services
(wood production, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, etc.).

**** Competition between species
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: competition-between-species
:END:
Species can compete with each other for finite resources (e.g. water,
nutrients or sunlight). Competition is considered to be an important
mechanism determining population size, biomass and species richness in
the community. Through our research, we try to identify the strategy
of each species regarding competition for resources in the community
basing our studies on species traits, demography and
phylogeny. Selected references: [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1581-9][3]], [[https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01751.x][4]], [[https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01803.x][12]], [[https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16476][22]].

**** Intraspecific variability
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: intraspecific-variability
:END:
Intraspecific variability is the overall variability of biological
characteristics (functional traits, life-history characteristics)
expressed by individuals within a species. Observed intraspecific
variability has various causes including genetics and phenotypic
plasticity. Intraspecific variability has often been left aside in
favor of interspecific variability to explain community
functioning. In our research group, we work at quantifying
intraspecific variability and we study its effect on species
competition. Selected references: [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1581-9][3]], [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2011.04.003][5]], [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-010-0095-8][8]].

**** Rare species
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rare-species
:END:
A rare species is a group of organisms that are very uncommon or
scarce in a community. In tropical forests, where the number of
species may be greater than 100 per hectare, many species are rare and
represented only by a few individuals. Knowledge about these species
is usually scarce.  This is problematic as to understand the
functioning of the community, we need information on the behavior of
each species. In our research team, we develop approaches to make the
most of the few observations that is available for rare species. As an
alternative to the approach by group of species or the approach by
functional traits, we investigate the interest of using hierarchical
mixed effect models to characterize rare species. This type of models
is a compromise between a theoretical and biologically coherent
average model for all species and a species specific model estimated
from the few observations for each species.  Selected references:

*** Conservation biology
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: conservation-biology
:END:
Conservation biology is the scientific study of the nature and status
of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their
habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the
erosion of biotic interactions. Land-use change and climate change are
two main threats to biodiversity. Through our research group, we try
to provide tools for conservation planning with the aim of reducing
tropical deforestation and adapting to climate-change.

**** Deforestation, carbon emissions, and biodiversity loss
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: avoiding-deforestation
:END:
Tropical deforestation is responsible for a major decline in
biodiversity, for a considerable proportion (6-17%) of global carbon
dioxide emissions that affect climate change and is the first step
toward land desertification. Around 13 million hectares of tropical
forest are deforested each year around the world. The REDD+ programme
(Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) has
emerged as a new potential to curb deforestation in developing
countries combining both development and conservation actions. Our
research group work at providing accurate estimates of carbon stocks
in tropical forests and identifying the social and environmental
causes of deforestation to improve conservation planning. Selected

**** Species vulnerability to climate change
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adaptation-to-climate-change
:END:
Biodiversity is affected by current anthropogenic climate change.
Although throughout Earth's history the climate has always changed
with ecosystems and species coming and going, current rapid climate
change affects ecosystems and species ability to adapt and so
biodiversity loss increases. The current extinction rate is now
approaching 1,000 times the background rate rivaling the five mass
extinctions of past geologic history. Within our research group, we
assess the vulnerability of tree species or forest-restricted animal
species to climate change. Using species distribution models and
projecting species distribution under future climate, our objective is
to identify climatic refugea area for biodiversity. Using biodiversity
maps, we propose conservation strategies to adapt to climate change,
increasing the effectiveness of present protected area
networks. Selected references: [[https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/hSDM][hSDM]], [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.06.007][15]], [[https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12548][24]].

*** Statistics applied to ecology
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: statistics-applied-to-ecology
:END:
Statistical models can be used to draw inferences about the ecological
process or population under study. Inference is a vital element of
scientific advance, since it provides a way to draw conclusions from
data that are subject to random variation. Models can then be used to
forecast ecological processes and provide support to managers for
decision making. Within our research group, we work at providing new
statistical methods and tools to solve methodological problems
associated to the analysis of ecological data-sets, thus offering
opportunities to provide new answers to scientific questions in
ecology.

To do so, we are particularly focused on the development of
hierarchical Bayesian models. We try to make the statistical methods
and functions we develop available in R or Python packages. We
developed various methods and tools for modelling anthropogenic
deforestation (forestatrisk, phcfM), species distribution (jSDM,
hSDM), and tropical forest dynamics (twoe). We have also contributed
to the development of functions for parameter inference in a
hierarchical Bayesian framework that have been included in packages
with broad applications (MCMCpack). Selected references: [[https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/hSDM][hSDM]], [[https://twoe.sourceforge.net][twoe]],
