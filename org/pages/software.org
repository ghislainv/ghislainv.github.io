*** jSDM
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: jsdm
:END:

=jSDM= is an R package for fitting joint species distribution models
(JSDMs) in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The Gibbs sampler is
written in C++ using Rcpp, Armadillo, and GSL to maximize computation
efficiency. [[https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/jSDM]].

=hSDM= is an R package for fitting hierarchical Bayesian species
distribution models (HSDMs). It includes functions to fit mixture
models (site-occupancy, N-mixture, ZIB, and ZIP models) accounting for
imperfect detection, excess of zeros in the observations, and spatial
autocorrelation (through an intrinsic CAR process). Functions use an
adaptive Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm written in C code. This
makes parameter inference faster than with software commonly used to
fit such models (such as JAGS) and allows analyzing very large
data-sets (typically with more than tens of thousands grid
cells). [[https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/hSDM]].

*** gecevar
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gecevar
:END:

=gecevar= provides a set of climatic and environmental data for a given
area of interest (eg. country scale) that can be used for ecological
analyses. Data come from a variety of sources (eg. Chelsa,
OpenStreetMap, TropicalMoistForest, SRTMv4.1, SoilGrids). Climatic and
environmental data are available as multiband raster files at a
resolution and in the coordinate reference system provided by the
user. [[https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/gecevar]].


*** MCMCpack (contribution to)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mcmcpack
:END:
   
=MCMCpack= (Markov chain Monte Carlo Package) is an R package which
includes functions to perform Bayesian inference using posterior
simulation for a number of statistical models. Most simulation is done
in compiled C++ written with the [[https://scythe.lsa.umich.edu/][=Scythe=]] statistical library. I have
contributed to =MCMCpack= with the development of functions for
generalized linear mixed models (glmm): =MCMChregress()= for Gaussian
models, =MCMChlogit()= for Bernoulli models (logit link function), and
=MCMChpoisson()= for Poisson models (log link
function). [[https://cran.r-project.org/package=MCMCpack]].

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: phcfm
:END:
  
=phcfM= is an R package for modelling anthropogenic deforestation. It
was initially developed to obtain REDD+ baseline scenarios of
deforestation for the /programme holistique de conservation des forêts
à Madagascar/ (from which the package was named after). It includes
two main functions: (i) =demography()=, to model the population growth
with time in a hierarchical Bayesian framework using population census
data and Gaussian linear mixed models, (ii) =deforestation()=, to
model the deforestation process in a hierarchical Bayesian framework
using land-cover change data and Binomial logistic regression models
with variable time-intervals between land-cover observations.
   
A GRASS location (=phcfM_SM=) and two mapsets with geographical data
layers (=PERMANENT= and =study_area_4=) are available to illustrate
the use of the =phcfM= R package. Associated with the GRASS location, a
directory (=./scripts=) includes the data and the R/GRASS scripts used
for the demographic and deforestation models.

*** twoe
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: twoe
:END:

=twoe= (2e) is a software which aims first at estimating the
demographic parameters of tropical tree species from permanent forest
plot data (through an R package), and second at simulating forest
dynamics (through a [[https://capsis.cirad.fr/][Capsis]] module). [[https://twoe.sourceforge.net]].

** Python packages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: python-packages
:END:

*** forestatrisk
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: forestatrisk
:END:

The =forestatrisk= Python package can be used to model the tropical
deforestation spatially, predict the spatial risk of deforestation,
and forecast the future forest cover in the tropics. It provides
functions to estimate the spatial probability of deforestation as a
function of various spatial explanatory variables. Spatial explanatory
variables can be derived from topography (altitude, slope, and
aspect), accessibility (distance to roads, towns, and forest edge),
deforestation history (distance to previous deforestation), or land
conservation status (eg. protected area) for
example. https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/forestatrisk.

*** pywdpa
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pywdpa
:END:

The =pywdpa= Python package is an interface to the World Database on
Protected Areas (WDPA) hosted on the Protected Planet website at
https://www.protectedplanet.net. The =pywdpa= package provides
functions to download shapefiles of protected areas (PA) for any
countries with an iso3 code using the Protected Planet API at
https://api.protectedplanet.net. The =pywdpa= package translates some
functions of the R package =worldpa=
(https://github.com/FRBCesab/worldpa) in the Python
language. https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/pywdpa.

*** riskmapjnr
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: riskmapjnr
:END:

The =riskmapjnr= Python package can be used to obtain maps of the
spatial risk of deforestation and forest degradation following the
methodology developed in the context of the Jurisdictional and Nested
REDD+ (JNR) and using only a forest cover change map as
input. https://ecology.ghislainv.fr/riskmapjnr.
