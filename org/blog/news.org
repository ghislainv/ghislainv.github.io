*Mar. 31, 2023*\\
Philippe Birnbaum and Thomas Ibanez from UMR AMAP have compiled an impressive data-set of 169,376 tree occurrences in New Caledonia. Trees from this data-set belong to 1176 species, 93 families, and 285 genera. Occurrences were retrieved from the New Caledonian Plant Inventory and Permanent Plot Network ([[https://niamoto.nc/peuplement/][NC-PIPPN]]), the Herbarium of New Caledonia database ([[http://publish.plantnet-project.org/project/nou][NOU]]), [[https://www.gbif.org][GBIF]], and other additional datasets. Among these species, 303 species (28%) were found preferentially (>90% of their occurrences) on ultramafic soils, and 62 species were found exclusively on this type of soils. Ultramafic soils, which cover 33% of New Caledonia, exhibit low concentration of nutrients (N, P, and K), and high concentration of magnesium (Mg) causing calcium (Ca) deficiency (low Ca/Mg ratio) or Mg toxicity. They also often exhibit high concentration of potentially phytotoxic elements such as nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), or chromium (Cr), and are generally low in water-holding capacity. Evolution have thus selected tree species with unique adaptative strategies to grow and survive in this constrained environment. According to the results of the article, 91% of the tree species found on ultramafic soils are endemic to New Caledonia. Interestingly, tree communities on ultramafic soils in New Caledonia were found to be different depending on the location of the ultramafic areas, suggesting that other environmental factors than soil filter species and determine species assemblage. Tree species found preferentially on ultramafic soils are potentially threatened by mining activities, for the extraction of nickel in particular. In the article, authors underline the fact that the protected area network should be extended to cover more of the ultramafic areas in New Caledonia.

We have organized a five-day workshop at AMAP in Montpellier on 6-10 March, 2023 for the [[file:research.html#metradica][METRADICA]] project. We had 12 participants in total along the week. We advanced the work on the different tasks of the project and discussed the first results obtained by Marion, Jeanne, and Salman since the beginning of their PhD and postdoc within the project.

The first [[https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9860][article]] of Camille's PhD has been accepted for publication in /Ecology and Evolution/. Congratulations Camille! I think this article is important to understand better the nature of intraspecific variability and improve our understanding of the coexistence of a large number of species competing for the same resources (the "biodiversity paradox") in hyper-diverse communities, such as tropical forests. In the article, we show that a large part of the intraspecific variability observed in trees can be associated with an incomplete characterization of the environment. We show that the large intraspecific variability observed in data does not imply species niche overlap and that individuals of the same species have more similar performances than individuals from different species in a given environment. These results have important implications for elucidating the biodiversity paradox. Community models achieving coexistence of a large number of species commonly rely on low-dimensional perfect trade-offs or neutral processes, which does not correspond to our naturalistic knowledge of species and habitats. We thus defend the idea of a multidimensional niche /à la/ Hutchinson to explain species coexistence. Each species is different and outperforms the others in a given environment, which varies in space and time in a high number of dimensions, thus allowing the coexistence of a large number of species.
